              h3 11:30 - 12:15
              p Photographer and Sony Ambassador Keith Bernstein has had the opportunity to shoot some unique photos a whole range of different situations, meeting a whole number of interesting people along the way and winning a variety of different awards.
              p In this 45-minute session, Keith will talk about the unforeseen and totally unpredictable route that led him to work with Clint Eastwood. More than 20 years as a photojournalist has had a direct impact on this career, leading him to become Clint Film still photographer for Clint Eastwood’s last seven movies (including Sully, American Sniper and Eye in the Sky) with another two planned for 2017!
              p.pc-spacer-xl The two seemingly different worlds of photojournalism and cinema proved to be linked and connected in ways that Keith has seen when looking back. This talk will show you a range of shots from his time working with Clint Eastwood and how these two contrasting subject areas are brought together.

              p Throughout the Imaging Festival, Canon users can get their Digital SLR sensor cleaned for FREE by technical experts from Canon UKs service centre (although we are accepting charitable donations going to a local charity.)
              p There are set times throughout the day to drop your camera in, and you can then collect it around 1 hour later. Simply click on the time that you would like to bring your camera into us to book your slot. We are able to allow one camera per person, and the camera must be a Canon. There is a maximum number of cameras we can clean per slot. You can also bring in your camera on the day, although we cannot guarantee the sensor clean will be done within the hour.
              p The Canon technicians will clean the accessible surface of the sensor as best possible. We cannot guarantee to remove every particle on the surface, but in the majority of cases, the sensor is left very clean. Very occasionally, particles can get between the filter and the sensor and if this happens, the Canon technicians will not remove the filter to clean beneath it. This would have to be booked in with Canon at a separate time.
              p Please help us to help you and ensure that when you deliver your camera for your FREE sensor clean that you do so along with the following:
              ul
                li Camera Body Cap / Lens
                li Fully Charged Battery
              p and that you have downloaded any image files or data to your satisfaction and have removed the memory card(s).
              p.pc-spacer-xl Whilst conducting the initial checks on the camera, we will contact you before continuing if we feel it is unsafe to clean the sensor - due to existing scratches or stubborn marks that could cause further damage.
