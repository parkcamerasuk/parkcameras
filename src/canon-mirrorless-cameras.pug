              p Canon offer a wide range of mirrorless cameras and lenses that give you everything you need to take professional quality images in a compact and affordable package. Mirrorless cameras - also known as compact system cameras or CSCs - occupy a sweet spot between larger digital SLRs and convenient but limited compact cameras. Unlike compact cameras, they support interchangeable lenses and so are far more versatile, but are also much more lightweight and portable than DSLRs and do not require a mirror assembly - hence their name.

                    b Key Features
                  li Mirrorless cameras frame using what the sensor 'sees' as opposed to using optical views.
                  li Lenses can be positioned closer to the sensor than with DSLRs, so can be made smaller, lighter, and less expensive - and in turn can feature wider apertures.
                  li Thanks to their shorter flange back distance, most types of lens systems can be used - with adapters.
                  li Noise is minimised as there is no moving mirror to produce any sound.
                  li Manual mode can be easier to use as the image is always read from the sensor - such as with focus peaking to assist in focus acquisition.
                  li In manual mode, vintage lenses can be used (provided a compatible adapter is available) - which most other modern cameras cannot support.

              p Canon EF-M mount lenses are specifically designed for Canon mirrorless cameras and include all the advantages of an interchangeable lens camera system, but in a more compact and lightweight form.
              p The Canon EOS M range of cameras work not only with EF-M mount lenses, but also with Canon EF and Canon EF-S lenses (with the use of the Canon EF-EOS M mount adapter) that are normally used on Canon digital SLR cameras.
              img(src='https://content.parkcameras.com/5/1/images/landing_pages/canon-mirrorless/images-efmlenses.jpg' alt='Canon EF-M Lenses', style='margin: 2rem 0;')
              p A standout lens the

                | - with its tiny pancake lens profile plus effective 35mm focal length - it is the perfect choice for street photography or everyday use.
              p For those interested in macro photography, we can highly recommend the latest addition to the EF-M lens family, the 
                a(href='https://www.parkcameras.com/p/1245230W', target='_blank' title='Canon EF-M 28mm f/3.5 Macro IS STM') Canon EF-M 28mm f/3.5 Macro IS STM Lens
                |. The unique selling point of this lens being the integrated LED Macro Lite, which helps to remove shadow and darkness from your close-up shots. Added to these great features are its 130g weight, minimum working distance of 13mm and class leading magnifaction abilities.
              p As with all Canon products, you can be assured that quality, ease of use, and reliability come as standard.
