              p Using just this this one lens, photographers can readily enjoy the power of the ultra-telephoto range to bring distant subjects closer as well as the perspective-flattening effects that only extreme telephoto settings can achieve. This all-in-one zoom lens is ideal for travel and everyday carry and allows a photographer to switch from wide-angle to ultra-telephoto without changing lenses, making it faster and easier to capture a much wider range of subjects including travel scenes, wildlife, action sports, landscapes, cityscapes, portraits and food.

                b Andy Rouse 
                | for this 45-minute session where he talks about his love of Aviation Photography. Using his skillset from his many years as a wildlife photographer, Andy recently turned his camera towards the skies, shooting a whole range of different aircraft including polish Migs, Hawks, and even the legendary Vulcan.
              p Andy will be showcasing a range of his recent shots, analysing them from both a technical and aesthetic standpoint, sharing with you his tips and tricks to get the best out of the kit that you use.
              p Also within this 60-minute session Andy will show you a selection of his favourite shots from the past year, including some fantastic air-to-air shots, and will allow you to discover the story behind the shot! He’ll describe the different equipment that he used to capture these fantastic shots, to hopefully inspire you to try a different angle of photography. With a number of airshows held in the UK, this is an ideal opportunity to get some tips from an honest photographer.
              p.pc-spacer-xl Throughout the session there will be plenty of time to have your questions answered, with the opportunity to get your hands on the kit that Andy describes in the Canon area of the store after the session.

                | There are set times throughout the day to drop your camera in, and you can then collect it around 1 hour later. Simply click on the time that you would like to bring your camera into us to book your slot. We are able to allow one camera per person, and the camera must be a Canon. There is a maximum number of cameras we can clean per slot. You can also bring in your camera on the day, although we cannot guarantee the sensor clean will be done within the hour.
              p
                | The Canon technicians will clean the accessible surface of the sensor as best possible. We cannot guarantee to remove every particle on the surface, but in the majority of cases, the sensor is left very clean. Very occasionally, particles can get between the filter and the sensor and if this happens, the Canon technicians will not remove the filter to clean beneath it. This would have to be booked in with Canon at a separate time.
              p
                | Please help us to help you and ensure that when you deliver your camera for your FREE sensor clean that you do so along with the following:
              ul
                li Camera Body Cap / Lens
                li Fully Charged Battery
              p
                | and that you have downloaded any image files or data to your satisfaction and have removed the memory card(s).
              p
                | Whilst conducting the initial checks on the camera, we will contact you before continuing if we feel it is unsafe to clean the sensor - due to existing scratches or stubborn marks that could cause further damage.
