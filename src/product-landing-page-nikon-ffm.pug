    p Nikon’s long-awaited launch into the full-frame mirrorless market has finally arrived with the release of the NIKON Z7 and Z6, with new 24-70mm f/4 zoom lens, 35mm f/1.8 and 50mm f/1.8 lenses available as launch. With the introduction of the new Nikon Z-NIKKOR mount, Nikon say they are putting in the groundwork for the next 100 years and launching a new era of optical perfection, with ground-breaking low-light performance.
    p The Nikon Z7 & Z6 both feature specifications to rival professional level Digital SLRs (DSLRs), with the benefits that full-frame mirrorless have to offer – small, incredible autofocus, and the capacity to shoot & process at frame rates that a DSLR would struggle to match.
    p The camera bodies are noticeably smaller and lighter than a DSLR with equivalent specification. Nikon have focused on making it comfortable to hold - with a deep grip and textured grip. The rear of the cameras have controls that are easily accessible (with custom functions to allow for personalisation), with the option to use either the high resolution 3.6m dot Eye View Finder or the tilt and touch 3.2” LCD screen.
