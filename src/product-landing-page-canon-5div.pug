            p Alongside the new Canon 5D Mark IV comes a couple of handy accessories - namely the newly designed battery grip, the Canon BG-E20 Battery Grip. Designed specifically to match the style of the 5D Mark IV it is the ideal grip accessory to give you that extra power boost and added controls to enhance vertical shooting. There is also a protective cloth, the Canon PC-E1 Protecting Cloth. Add to that a whole host of accessories that are conveniently compatible from past models of the Canon 5D - such as the Canon LP-E6N Battery and Canon 5D Mark IV compatible battery charger.
