                    p Park Cameras was established in 1971 in Burgess Hill, West Sussex. For over forty years we have forged a reputation across the photographic industry as one of the top independent photographic retailers in the UK, serving the needs of all photographers, from enthusiasts through to professionals, through the very highest level of customer service.
                    
                    p In 2008 we radically altered our business approach, creating a bespoke, purpose-built showroom which successfully married the very latest instore experience with our staff’s unrivalled level of photographic knowledge and customer care.
                    
                    p November 2013 saw another milestone in Park Cameras history as we set about opening our brand new store in London, run with the same ethos as Burgess Hill we're well on our way to becoming London's best camera store.
