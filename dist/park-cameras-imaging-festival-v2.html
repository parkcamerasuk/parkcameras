          <h3>Take your portrait shots to new heights with Wayne Johns and Fujifilm</h3>
          <h3><b>09:15 - 10:45</b></h3>
          <p>Join professional photographer <b>Wayne Johns </b>as he shows you how you can get some fantastic results using the new Fujifilm GFX 50S and the Fujifilm X-series family of cameras and high precision X-mount lenses and take your photography to new heights in variety of different environments.</p>
          <p>The Fujifilm GFX-50S burst on to the scene as one of the first Mirrorless Medium Format Digital Cameras earlier in 2017, packing a huge sensor into a smaller form factor than we were used to seeing – meaning we were no longer using Medium Format cameras for just studio photography.</p>
          <p>With a whole host of new cameras available in the X-series range of cameras, attending this session will also allow you to learn more about cameras including the Fujifilm X-T2, X-T20 and more – including some of the new XF lenses that have also landed in the last year.</p>
          <p>An inspirational talker, and teacher, Wayne Johns will share his experience and knowledge along the way, as you can also expect to get yourself some facetime with these new cameras and lenses to practice these new abilities.</p>
          <p class="pc-spacer-xl">Technical experts from Fujifilm UK will also be on-hand to offer further help and advice, and to allow you the chance to get hands-on with Fujifilm's new medium format mirrorless camera system and the X-series range.</p><a class="pc-btn-standard" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/take-your-portrait-shots-to-new-heights-with-wayne-johns-and-fujifilm-tickets-35505170922" target="_blank" title="Book Take Your Photography to New Heights with Wayne Johns and Fujifilm">Book Now          </a>

          <p>Throughout the Imaging Festival, <b>Canon users</b>                                                                                                                                                can get their Digital SLR sensor cleaned for FREE by technical experts from Canon UKs service centre (although we are accepting charitable donations going to a local charity.)</p>
          <p>There are set times throughout the day to drop your camera in, and you can then collect it around 1 hour later. Simply click on the time that you would like to bring your camera into us to book your slot. We are able to allow one camera per person, and the camera must be a Canon. There is a maximum number of cameras we can clean per slot. You can also bring in your camera on the day, although we cannot guarantee the sensor clean will be done within the hour.</p>
          <p>The Canon technicians will clean the accessible surface of the sensor as best possible. We cannot guarantee to remove every particle on the surface, but in the majority of cases, the sensor is left very clean. Very occasionally, particles can get between the filter and the sensor and if this happens, the Canon technicians will not remove the filter to clean beneath it. This would have to be booked in with Canon at a separate time.</p>
          <p>Please help us to help you and ensure that when you deliver your camera for your FREE sensor clean that you do so along with the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Camera Body Cap / Lens</li>
            <li>Fully Charged Battery</li>
          </ul>
          <p>and that you have downloaded any image files or data to your satisfaction and have removed the memory card(s).</p>
          <p>Whilst conducting the initial checks on the camera, we will contact you before continuing if we feel it is unsafe to clean the sensor - due to existing scratches or stubborn marks that could cause further damage.</p>
