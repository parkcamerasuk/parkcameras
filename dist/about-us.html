        <p>Park Cameras, a family-run business, first opened its door over 45 years ago with the single-minded ambition of changing the face of independent photography retailers. With the challenge accepted by founder Reg Atkins, with just &pound;500 in cash, a range of used stock and an old banger for transportation – Park Cameras was born.</p>
        <p>Today, Park Cameras consists of two successful stores, one in West Sussex which doubles as our Head Office and one in the heart of London’s bustling streets – both with an expansive range of products for our customers to touch and try, and ultimately leave elated with.</p>
        <p>Alongside this we have a rapidly expanding web team, based in our Burgess Hill HQ, working with the increasingly growing contact centre and warehouse operations teams to help those customers over the phone and on the internet.</p>

          <h4>1971</h4>
          <p><span id="startYear"></span> years ago, in Lower Church Road, Park Cameras opened its doors for the first time to sell its first photographic equipment, initially armed with just £500 worth of used cameras as stock. The foundations of our company were set in place, and Reg Atkins would be at the helm of the operation for over 35 years, eventually handing over the reins to his son Roscoe.</p>

        <div class="pc-column pc-col2 pc-order-3">
          <h4>1976 – Moved to a larger store</h4>
          <p>Just a short 5 years later, our home for the next 30 plus years, <a href="http://bit.ly/2y0Yram" target="_blank">115 Church Road in Burgess Hill</a> saw us grow through the ages as Park Cameras developed into the largest independent photographic retailer in Sussex.

          <h4>1999 – Website Launched</h4>
          <p>In 1999 rather than the traditional bricks and mortar approach, we decided to delve into the internet for our next phase of expansion. With current Managing Director, Roscoe Atkins, and former Burgess Hill store manager Chris Reszke (now heading up our burgeoning used department) working together to launch our first website.</p>
          <p>Throughout the years we have gone through various designs of our website to what we have here today in order to keep up with the demands of an ever-changing environment. Our team has grown exponentially over the past few years to cope with the increased demands of a more tech-savvy customer. This growth has seen Park Cameras become the largest independent photographic retailer online and one which we strongly believe is down to following our in-store maxims of providing top customer service and expert knowledge.</p>

          <h4>2000 – Haywards Heath Store</h4>
          <p>Hot on the heels of our online expansion was our first foray into branching out, with an opportunity to open up an extra shop just a few miles down the road from our Burgess Hill store. </p>
          <p>The Hayward’s Heath store allowed us to serve a greater number of people in the local area and foretold the company’s visions of further growth in the competitive camera market.</p>

          <h4>2008 – Moved to our new home</h4>
          <p>In 2008 we moved to our current home, a bespoke project managed by the father-and-son team of Reg and Roscoe Atkins which would see the most ambitious undertaking of our company in the lead up to its 40th birthday.</p>
          <p>To celebrate the occasion, we teamed up with our old friends at Olympus to attract the impressively famous photographer David Bailey to mark the occasion with a careful scissor snip to some red ribbon, to officially mark the opening of our new premises.</p>
          <p>It was also a goodbye to both of our previous stores in Burgess Hill and Haywards Heath – which held many good memories for us, but were the beginnings of greater things to come.</p>
          <p>With a vast area for showing off a vast range of camera, lenses and accessories from a variety of brands we also managed to squeeze in a full-blown studio area, a training room complete with PCs and Apple Macs plus our offices for running the contact centre and web operations. </p>
          <p>We envisage this Burgess Hill location to remain our headquarters for some time whilst we expand our operations even more throughout the years to come.</p>

          <h4>2010 – First Imaging Festival</h4>
          <p>Boasting a great deal more space in our new home we introduced our ‘Imaging Festival’ in the summer of 2010 – one of the largest one-day photo events in the country. </p>
          <p>The Imaging Festival became an annual affair, with us opening our doors to hundreds of customers who could receive free seminars from professional photographers, expert advice from many of our suppliers and incredibly offers that are exclusively for that day only.</p>
          <p>With the addition of a London branch we were able to expand out the event across two weekends in our two different locations to offer this opportunity to more of our customers.</p>
          <p>Over the years we’ve been delighted to welcome faces old and new, and thoroughly enjoy all the hard work and preparation that makes this day come together!</p>

          <h4>2013 – London Store</h4>
          <p>With our Burgess Hill headquarters and website/phone operations flourishing we decided to expand out to an entirely new region for us, with the opening of a new store in the capital. </p>
          <p>In a prime location of Rathbone Place, just a short stroll from Tottenham Court Road tube station, our newest store was an ambitious new challenge for the company and one that has helped us go from strength-to-strength over the years since opening.</p>
          <p>The same values apply to our London store, a massive selection of products for customers to touch and try in-store with expert advice and that same customer service level you will see whether in London, Burgess Hill, speaking on the phone or sending us an e-mail! </p>
