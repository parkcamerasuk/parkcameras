          <h3>What is Black Friday?</h3>
          <p>Black Friday orignally began in America and made it across the pond several years ago. There are varying folklores about where it originated, including the theory that suggests it was the biggest sales day of the year when retailers traditionally went from being in 'the red' to in 'the black' and began making profit.</p>
          <p>No-one really knows when or where Black Friday started, but one this is for sure - it's now cemented itself as the biggest shopping day of the year in the UK, replacing the traditional Boxing Day and New Year Sales a couple of years ago.</p>
