          <h3>Creative portraits in tight spaces with Gavin Hoey</h3>
          <h3><strong>10:00am, 12:30pm or 3:45pm</strong></h3>
          <p class="pc-spacer-l">Shooting creative portraits with small flashes is what this demo is all about. Olympus ambassador Gavin Hoey will be on hand to share some top tips for moving beyond the basic headshot.</p>
          <p class="pc-spacer-l">Starting with simple lighting, Gavin will show you that you don’t need a big studio to shoot eye-catching portraits. Adding props, moving lights and being imaginative could just be the catalyst that takes you and your portrait photography to the next level.</p>
          <p class="pc-spacer-l">During the demo Gavin will be shooting with the<a href="/p/4010971B/mirrorless-cameras/olympus/om-d-e-m1-mark-ii-digital-mirrorless-camera-body">Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II</a>                                                                                                                                                                                and talk about his favourite settings and lenses. He'll also cover how to shoot in FP Sync mode (High Speed Sync) useful when shooting with large apertures.</p>
          <p class="pc-spacer-l">Why not bring your camera and SD card along and (time permitting) try out Gavin’s tips for yourself. This session will be held at multiple times of the day, and will be held on the shop floor.</p><a class="pc-btn-standard" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/creative-portraits-in-tight-spaces-with-gavin-hoey-tickets-40790714124" target="_blank" title="Book Take Your Photography to New Heights with Wayne Johns and Fujifilm">Book Now</a>
